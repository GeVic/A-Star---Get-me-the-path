### What is A* algorithm?
A* search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals.

### Why A* algorithm?
It's a smart algorithm which seperates it from the other conventional algorithms. It chooses the nodes with least heuristic values.



### How to calculate Heuristics?
There are many ways to calculate heuristics i.e. g score. The two heuristics approximation I tried using in this project are:
1. Euclidean Distance
2. Manhattan Distance
