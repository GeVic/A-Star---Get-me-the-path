**Black Squares** - Obstacles <br/>
**Yellow Squares** - Open Set <br/>
**Red Squares** - CLosed Set <br/>
**Blue Vertex** - Optimal Path

You can see the algo reach it's target at https://gevic.github.io/A-Star-Visualization/

### What is A* algorithm?
A* search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals.

### Why A* algorithm?
It's a smart algorithm which seperates it from the other conventional algorithms. It chooses the nodes with least heuristic values.



### How to calculate Heuristics?
There are many ways to calculate heuristics i.e. **H score**. The two heuristics approximation I tried using in this project are:
**1. Euclidean Distance** <br/>
**2. Manhattan Distance**
